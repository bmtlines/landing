			<h1>Current train models</h1>

			<p>These are four of the most run subway models. The letter lines have wider trains than the number lines.</p>
			<p>The R46 has been running since 1975, and is planned to be phased out of service by the end of the decade.</p>
			<p>The R62 has been running since 1985, and is mostly used on the local number lines.</p>
			<p>The R142 is a more recent version of the R62 as it has been running since 2000 and is mostly used on the express number lines.</p>
			<p>The R179 is the most recent subway car as it was introduced into the system in 2017. It is widely used on the letter lines.</p>
